Compiled vs Interpreted Languages:

Compiled languages translate the entire code into machine language at once before execution. This is typically done by a compiler (e.g., C, C++). They tend to be faster in execution but less flexible during development.

Interpreted languages execute code line-by-line using an interpreter (e.g., Python, JavaScript). They are slower but allow for easier debugging and quicker testing during development.

Python is an interpreted language because it executes instructions line by line using the Python interpreter.
